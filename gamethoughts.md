# Couple of ideas for games to make for testing

## Super simple roguelike

Probably a good initial game to have some fun with getting all the basics working, maybe even push a bit of procedural map generation.

## Fantasy bandit/mercenary game in the spirit of xcom

 - start as a bandit/mercenary chief, choosing a base in one of several territories (human/elven/dwarf/goblin/etc...)
 - take quests for money, or straight loot, get allies/enemies while doing so
 - potentially an overarching plot where you can save the world from a menance (demonic?) through your elite squads
 - tech up in magic, goblic alchemy, dwarven blacksmiths etc
 - base invasions and all that good stuff
 - turn based battles of course!

 Probably a bit ambitious off the bat!

 ## Gold-box classic style game with exploration and turn based battles

 - basically something like champions of krynn, although with a simplified rule set (not d&d), using roguelike engine from the first game
 - good test-bed for getting the turn-based squad combat in place for the fantasy x-com alike
